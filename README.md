# Vanilla REINFORCE with Pytorch : Hands-on

This repo is only meant to be used through the following colab : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EnJv5UywETUzrmw6arAJI8qibxQwVXFn?usp=sharing.
It was created in the context of the 2022 RL Course at ENSAE.

The goal of this hands-on is to fill in the code to implement the vanilla REINFORCE algorithm to solve Gym's CartPole. It uses Pytorch to implement the required Neural network.

Estimated time approx. 3 hours.

Author : Yann Berthelot

Example of solution will be available after the Hands-On is finished.
